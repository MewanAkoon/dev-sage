## Sets

- **Definition**:

  - A set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any particular order.
  - It is a collection of distinct objects.

- **Operations**:

  - **Add**: Adds a new element to the set if it is not already present. Complexity: O(1) on average, depending on the underlying implementation.
  - **Remove**: Removes a specified element from the set. Complexity: O(1) on average, depending on the implementation.
  - **Contains**: Checks whether a specified element is present in the set. Complexity: O(1) on average.
  - **Union**: Combines all elements from two sets into a new set, eliminating duplicates. Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the size of the first set and m is the size of the second set.
  - **Intersection**: Creates a new set containing only elements that are present in both sets. Complexity: O(min(n, m)), where n is the size of the first set and m is the size of the second set.
  - **Difference**: Generates a new set containing elements that are present in the first set but not in the second set. Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the first set.
  - **Subset Testing**: Determines whether all elements of the first set are contained within the second set. Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the first set.

- **Applications**:
  - Database querying for distinct records.
  - Mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference.
  - Implementing various data structures and algorithms where uniqueness is a key attribute.

```typescript
class EnhancedSet<T> extends Set {
	constructor(items: T[]) {
		super(items);
	}

	// Returns the union of two sets
	union(otherSet: Set<T>): Set<T> {
		return new Set([...Array.from(this), Array.from(otherSet)]);
	}

	// Returns the intersection of two sets
	intersection(otherSet: Set<T>): Set<T> {
		const newSet = new Set<T>();

		otherSet.forEach((item) => {
			if (this.has(item)) newSet.add(item);
		});

		return newSet;
	}

	// Returns the difference of two sets
	difference(otherSet: Set<T>) {
		const newSet = new Set<T>();

		this.forEach((item) => {
			if (!otherSet.has(item)) newSet.add(item);
		});

		return newSet;
	}

	// Tests if the set is a subset of a different set
	subset(otherSet: Set<T>): boolean {
		return Array.from(this).every((item) => otherSet.has(item));
	}
}
