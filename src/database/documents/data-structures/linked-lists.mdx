## Linked Lists

- **Definition**:

  - A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (node) contains a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.
  - There are two types of linked lists: singly linked lists (where each node has a reference to the next node) and doubly linked lists (where each node has references to both the next and the previous nodes).

- **Properties**:

  - **Node**: The fundamental part of a linked list, which contains the data and a reference to the next node (and also the previous node in doubly linked lists).
  - **Head**: The first node in a linked list.
  - **Tail**: The last node in a linked list, which points to null in a singly linked list or can be a reference to the head in a circular linked list.

- **Operations**:

  - **Insertion**:
    - At the beginning: O(1)
    - At the end: O(n) for singly linked lists, O(1) if the tail is known or for doubly linked lists
    - After a given node: O(1)
  - **Deletion**:
    - At the beginning: O(1)
    - At the end: O(n) for singly linked lists without a tail pointer, O(1) for doubly linked lists
    - A specific node: O(n) to find the node, O(1) to remove it
  - **Search**: O(n) as it might require traversing the entire list to find the element.
  - **Traversal**: O(n) to visit each node.

- **Advantages**:

  - Dynamic size, allowing the list to grow or shrink as needed.
  - Efficient insertions and deletions, especially at the beginning or when the previous node is known.
  - Can efficiently represent sequences of items with uncertain sizes, avoiding the contiguous memory allocation issue.

- **Disadvantages**:

  - No direct access to elements by their position, making access times linear (O(n)).
  - Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
  - If not properly managed, can lead to memory leaks.

- **Applications**:

  - Suitable for applications with unpredictable memory needs.
  - Used as building blocks in the implementation of stacks, queues, and other complex data structures.
  - Can be used to implement graphs (adjacency list representation) and polynomial arithmetic.

- **Types of Linked Lists**:

  - **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node and the last node points to null.
  - **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has two links, the next link moves to the next node and the previous link moves to the previous node.
  - **Circular Linked List**: Similar to the singly or doubly linked list but the last node points back to the first node, creating a circle.

- **Traversal Methods**:
  - **Linear Traversal**: Start from the head and move through each node until the end is reached (or the desired node is found).
  - **Recursive Traversal**: Functions that call themselves with the next node as a parameter until a null reference or the end of the list is encountered.

The choice between a singly linked list and a doubly linked list depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for backward traversal or memory constraints.
