## Stacks

- **Definition**:

  - A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
  - Operations are performed from one end, referred to as the top of the stack.

- **Operations**:

  - **Push**: Adds an item to the top of the stack. Complexity: O(1).
  - **Pop**: Removes the top item from the stack and returns it. Complexity: O(1).
  - **Peek** or **Top**: Returns the top element without removing it. Complexity: O(1).

- **Applications**:

  - Undo mechanisms in text editors.
  - Backtracking paths in maze solving.
  - Syntax parsing in compilers.
  - Supporting function calls and returns in programming languages.

```typescript
class Stack<T = any> {
	constructor(private items: T[] = []) {}

	get length(): number {
		return this.items.length;
	}

	// Adds the value onto the end of the stack
	push(item: T): void {
		this.items.push(item);
	}

	// Removes and returns the value at the end of the stack
	pop(): T | undefined {
		return this.items.pop();
	}

	// Returns the value at the end of the stack
	peek(): T | undefined {
		return this.items[this.length - 1];
	}
}
