# Data Structures

Data structures are ways of storing and organizing data so it can be efficiently accessed, modified, and managed. Understanding the types of data structures and their uses is crucial for efficient algorithm design and software development.

## Types of Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures arrange data in a linear sequence, where each element is connected to its previous and next element in a single level. Data can be traversed in a single run-through.

- **Array**

  - Stores data elements of the same type in a contiguous memory location.
  - Offers fast access to elements via indexing but has fixed size and less flexibility in terms of adding or removing elements.

- **Stack**

  - Operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
  - Main operations include `push` (add an element), `pop` (remove and return the top element), and `peek` (view the top element without removing it).
  - Useful for backtracking algorithms, undo mechanisms in software, and syntax parsing.

- **Queue**

  - Operates on a First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
  - Main operations include `enqueue` (add an element to the end), `dequeue` (remove and return the front element), and `front` (view the front element without removing it).
  - Essential for scheduling algorithms, buffering, and managing tasks in order of arrival or priority.

- **Linked List**
  - Consists of nodes that contain a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.
  - Offers flexibility in memory allocation and size, easy insertion and deletion, but requires more memory and time to access specific elements.

### Non-Linear Data Structures

Non-linear data structures organize data in a non-sequential manner, allowing for hierarchical relationships and connections among data items.

- **Trees**

  - A hierarchical structure with a root value and subtrees of children, represented as a set of linked nodes.
  - Enables efficient searching, sorting, and traversing. Variants like Binary Trees, AVL Trees, and B-Trees optimize specific operations and use cases.

- **Graphs**
  - Consists of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (links) that might be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.
  - Supports the modeling of networks, facilitating algorithms for shortest paths, connectivity, and cycle detection.
  - Graph types include directed graphs (digraphs), undirected graphs, and trees (a type of acyclic graph).

## Overview

Choosing the right data structure can significantly impact the efficiency of algorithms and the overall performance of software. Linear data structures are generally simpler and suitable for problems with a known sequence of operations, while non-linear structures are essential for complex relationships and hierarchical data representation.

Understanding these data structures, along with their operations, applications, and limitations, is crucial for effective problem-solving and software development.
