# Facade Pattern Example: Smart Home System

This TypeScript code illustrates the use of the Facade Pattern in simplifying interactions with a complex smart home system comprising multiple subsystems: Lighting, Climate Control, and Security. The core problem addressed here is the complexity of managing diverse subsystems, each with its own set of operations. The Facade Pattern is employed to provide a simplified interface (SmartHomeFacade) to these subsystems, making it easier for the end-user to perform common tasks like "leaving home" or "coming home" without dealing with the intricacies of each subsystem.

## Subsystems

### Lighting System

Controls all lighting operations within the home.

```typescript
class LightingSystem {
	turnOffAllLights() {
		console.log('All lights turned off.');
	}

	turnOnHomeLights() {
		console.log('Home lights turned on.');
	}
}
```

### Climate Control System

Manages the temperature settings within the home.

```typescript
class ClimateControlSystem {
	setTemperature(temp: number) {
		console.log(`Temperature set to ${temp} degrees.`);
	}
}
```

### Security System

Handles the arming and disarming of the home's security.

```typescript
class SecuritySystem {
	armSecurity() {
		console.log('Security system armed.');
	}

	disarmSecurity() {
		console.log('Security system disarmed.');
	}
}
```

## Facade: SmartHomeFacade

Simplifies interactions with the subsystems by providing a unified interface for common tasks.

```typescript
class SmartHomeFacade {
	constructor(
		private lights: LightingSystem,
		private climate: ClimateControlSystem,
		private security: SecuritySystem
	) {}

	leavingHome() {
		this.lights.turnOffAllLights();
		this.climate.setTemperature(18); // Set an energy-saving temperature.
		this.security.armSecurity();
		console.log('Leaving home mode activated.');
	}

	comingHome() {
		this.lights.turnOnHomeLights();
		this.climate.setTemperature(22); // Set a comfortable temperature.
		this.security.disarmSecurity();
		console.log('Welcome home mode activated.');
	}
}
```

## Usage

Demonstration of using the facade to interact with the smart home system.

```typescript
const lights = new LightingSystem();
const climate = new ClimateControlSystem();
const security = new SecuritySystem();

const smartHome = new SmartHomeFacade(lights, climate, security);

// Simulating the user leaving the house
smartHome.leavingHome();

// Simulating the user coming back home
smartHome.comingHome();
```
