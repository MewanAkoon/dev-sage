# Mediator Pattern Example: Chat Room

This TypeScript code demonstrates the Mediator Pattern applied to a chat room scenario. The `ChatRoom` class acts as a mediator that facilitates communication between `User` instances. By having users communicate through the chat room instead of directly, the design reduces coupling between users and centralizes control logic for message passing in the `ChatRoom` mediator, simplifying maintenance and future extensions of the chat system.

## Interface: ChatRoomMediator

Defines the Mediator interface for sending messages and managing users.

```typescript
interface ChatRoomMediator {
	sendMessage(message: string, userId: number): void; // Method to send a message to a specific user.
	addUser(user: User): void; // Method to add a user to the chat room.
}
```

## Concrete Mediator: ChatRoom

Implementation of the `ChatRoomMediator` interface, managing communication between users.

```typescript
class ChatRoom implements ChatRoomMediator {
	private users: Map<number, User> = new Map(); // Holds a reference to all users in the chat room.

	sendMessage(message: string, userId: number): void {
		const user = this.users.get(userId); // Retrieves the recipient user by userId.
		if (user) {
			user.receive(message); // Delivers the message to the user.
		}
	}

	addUser(user: User): void {
		this.users.set(user.id, user); // Maps the user's id to the user object for easy retrieval.
	}
}
```

## Class: User

Represents a user in the chat room.

```typescript
class User {
	constructor(public id: number, private chatRoom: ChatRoomMediator) {
		this.chatRoom.addUser(this); // Adds itself to the chat room upon creation.
	}

	send(message: string, userId: number): void {
		console.log(`${this.id} sends message: ${message}`); // Logging for demonstration.
		this.chatRoom.sendMessage(message, userId); // Delegates the message sending to the chatRoom mediator.
	}

	receive(message: string): void {
		console.log(`${this.id} received message: ${message}`); // Logging for demonstration.
	}
}
```

## Demonstration

Example usage showing message exchange between users through the mediator.

```typescript
const chatRoom = new ChatRoom(); // Instantiates a new ChatRoom, acting as the mediator.

const user1 = new User(1, chatRoom); // Creates a new user with id "1" and adds it to the chat room.
const user2 = new User(2, chatRoom); // Creates another user with id "2" and adds it to the chat room.

user1.send('Hello, User 2!', 2); // User 1 sends a message to User 2 through the chat room.
user2.send('Hi, User 1! How are you?', 1); // User 2 responds to User 1 through the chat room.
```
