# Builder Pattern Example: Custom PC Construction

This example demonstrates the Builder Pattern, which is used for constructing complex objects, like custom PCs, step by step. The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations. It enables a high degree of control over the construction process and simplifies the creation of objects with many possible configurations.

## Product Class: PC

Represents the complex object being built.

```typescript
class PC {
	constructor(
		public processor: string = '',
		public ram: string = '',
		public storage: string = '',
		public graphicsCard: string = ''
	) {}

	describe(): void {
		console.log(
			`PC Configuration:\nProcessor: ${this.processor}\nRAM: ${this.ram}\nStorage: ${this.storage}\nGraphics Card: ${this.graphicsCard}`
		);
	}
}
```

## Builder Interface: PCBuilder

Outlines the steps involved in building the PC.

```typescript
interface PCBuilder {
	setProcessor(value: string): this;
	setRAM(value: string): this;
	setStorage(value: string): this;
	setGraphicsCard(value: string): this;
	build(): PC;
}
```

## Concrete Builder: GamingPCBuilder

Implements the builder interface for a specific type of PC, in this case, a Gaming PC.

```typescript
class GamingPCBuilder implements PCBuilder {
	private pc = new PC();

	setProcessor(value: string): this {
		this.pc.processor = value;
		return this;
	}

	setRAM(value: string): this {
		this.pc.ram = value;
		return this;
	}

	setStorage(value: string): this {
		this.pc.storage = value;
		return this;
	}

	setGraphicsCard(value: string): this {
		this.pc.graphicsCard = value;
		return this;
	}

	build(): PC {
		return this.pc;
	}
}
```

## Usage

Example of using the GamingPCBuilder to create a custom gaming PC.

```typescript
const builder = new GamingPCBuilder();
const myGamingPC = builder
	.setProcessor('Intel Core i9')
	.setRAM('32GB')
	.setStorage('1TB SSD')
	.setGraphicsCard('NVIDIA RTX 3080')
	.build();

myGamingPC.describe(); // Outputs the configuration details of the built PC
```
