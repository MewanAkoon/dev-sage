# Docker Notes

Docker is a powerful platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. By using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

## Key Components

### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using `docker build` users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

### docker-compose.yml

The `docker-compose.yml` file is a YAML file defining services, networks, and volumes for a Docker application. With a single command, you can create and start all the services defined in this file.

### .dockerignore

Similar to `.gitignore`, the `.dockerignore` file allows you to exclude files and directories from the context sent to the Docker daemon during builds. This can improve the build's performance by excluding non-relevant files.

## Common Commands

### `docker-compose up -d --build`

- **`-d`**: Detached mode. Run containers in the background.
- **`--build`**: Build images before starting containers.

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This command builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.

### `docker-compose down`

Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `up`.

- **`-v`**: Remove named volumes declared in the `volumes` section of the Compose file and anonymous volumes attached to containers.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### `docker system prune -a -f`

Removes all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced), and optionally, volumes.

- **`-a`**: Remove all unused images not just dangling ones.
- **`-f`**: Force the removal without confirmation.

```bash
docker system prune -a -f
```

### `docker rm <container_name> -fv`

Removes one or more containers.

- **`-f`**: Force the removal of a running container (uses SIGKILL).
- **`-v`**: Remove the volumes associated with the container.

```bash
docker rm <container_name> -fv
```

## Best Practices

- **Dockerfile Optimization**: Keep your Dockerfiles clean and efficient by using multi-stage builds, ordering instructions to leverage Docker's build cache, and minimizing the number of layers.
- **Security**: Use official or verified images as the basis for your containers, and regularly scan your images for vulnerabilities.

- **Resource Limits**: Always set resource limits in your container definitions to prevent any service from consuming too much of the host's resources.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for your containers to keep track of their health and performance.
