# Polymorphism: The Core of Flexible Object-Oriented Design

At its heart, polymorphism embodies the principle of "many forms" in object-oriented programming. It grants objects the ability to be recognized as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, enabling a single interface to represent a range of underlying forms (or classes).

## Key Concepts:

### - Inheritance: The Backbone of Reusability and Extension

Through inheritance, a class (subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass), facilitating code reusability and extension. It forms the hierarchical backbone of OOP, allowing for the creation of a structured and organized class hierarchy.

### - Polymorphism and Its Operational Diversity

Leveraging the methods inherited or overridden from parent classes, polymorphism allows these methods to execute distinct tasks, depending on the object's actual subclass. This operational diversity is what makes polymorphism a powerful tool for flexible and maintainable code.

### - Unified Interface with Diverse Implementations

Polymorphism enables objects of various classes to interact through a common superclass interface. This capability allows for the design of flexible and scalable systems where components can be easily interchanged or updated without altering the overarching system architecture.

## Advantages:

### - Flexibility

Code that uses polymorphic types can work with objects of different classes, making it more flexible.

### - Scalability

Adding new classes that fit into an existing class hierarchy is straightforward, enhancing the system's scalability.

### - Maintainability

Changes in specific implementations do not affect code that operates on more generic interfaces, improving maintainability.

Essentially, polymorphism, through the lens of inheritance and interface implementation, facilitates a level of abstraction that simplifies complex systems by allowing for the manipulation of objects as if they were of a single type, thus embodying the "one interface, multiple functions" paradigm of object-oriented design.

```typescript
abstract class Shape {
	abstract calculateArea(): number;

	printArea(): void {
		console.log(`The area is: ${this.calculateArea()}`);
	}
}

class Circle extends Shape {
	constructor(public radius: number) {
		super();
	}

	calculateArea(): number {
		return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
	}
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
	constructor(public width: number, public height: number) {
		super();
	}

	calculateArea(): number {
		return this.width * this.height;
	}
}
```
