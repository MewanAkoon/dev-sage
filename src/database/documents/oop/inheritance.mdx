# Inheritance: Architecting Reusability and Hierarchical Relationships in OOP

Inheritance stands as a key pillar in object-oriented programming, enabling classes to inherit and reuse code from other classes. This mechanism is instrumental in reducing redundancy, facilitating code maintenance, and fostering a natural hierarchical organization of program components.

## Core Aspects:

### - Code Reuse

At the heart of inheritance is the ability to reuse existing code. By inheriting from a superclass, a subclass can adopt its properties and methods without the need to rewrite those components, leading to a more efficient development process.

### - Hierarchical Structure

Inheritance introduces a clear hierarchical relationship between classes, mirroring real-world relationships and making the software design more intuitive and aligned with domain concepts.

### - Extensibility

Through inheritance, new functionality can be easily added to existing codebases. A subclass can extend the capabilities of its superclass, adding new properties and methods or overriding existing ones to modify their behavior.

### - The `extends` Keyword

In TypeScript, the `extends` keyword is used to declare that a class is inheriting from another class, establishing a parent-child relationship between the two.

## Benefits:

### - Enhanced Code Organization

Inheritance promotes a structured and organized codebase, making it easier to navigate and manage.

### - Reduced Duplication

By inheriting common functionality from a parent class, subclasses avoid the need to duplicate code, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

### - Improved Flexibility and Maintainability

Changes to shared functionality can be made in just one place (the superclass), automatically propagating to all subclasses, which simplifies maintenance and evolution of the codebase.

Inheritance is not merely a feature of object-oriented programming; it is a paradigm that mirrors the natural hierarchical relationships found in the real world, thereby providing a framework for creating more logical, intuitive, and scalable software architectures.

```typescript
// Base class (Superclass)
class Vehicle {
	constructor(public brand: string, public model: string) {}

	displayInfo(): void {
		console.log(`Vehicle Info: ${this.brand} ${this.model}`);
	}
}

// Subclass extending Vehicle
class Car extends Vehicle {
	constructor(brand: string, model: string, public doors: number) {
		super(brand, model); // Call the superclass's constructor
	}

	displayInfo(): void {
		super.displayInfo(); // Call the superclass's method
		console.log(`Doors: ${this.doors}`);
	}
}

// Another subclass extending Vehicle
class Truck extends Vehicle {
	constructor(brand: string, model: string, public towingCapacity: number) {
		super(brand, model); // Call the superclass's constructor
	}

	displayInfo(): void {
		super.displayInfo(); // Call the superclass's method
		console.log(`Towing Capacity: ${this.towingCapacity} lbs`);
	}
}
```
