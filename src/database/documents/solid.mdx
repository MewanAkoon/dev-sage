# SOLID Principles Guide

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Understanding these principles can significantly improve your coding skills and aid in discussing software design in interviews.

## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- **Definition**: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means that a class should only have one job or responsibility.
- **Benefits**: Easier to understand and test, promotes separation of concerns.

## O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- **Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
- **Benefits**: Enhances modularity and prevents breaking existing functionality when making changes.

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- **Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
- **Benefits**: Improves code reusability and class hierarchy design, ensures consistency and reliability in inheritance structures.

## I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- **Definition**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. This principle recommends splitting large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to know about the methods that are of interest to them.
- **Benefits**: Promotes a more decoupled system and provides flexibility to clients using the interfaces.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend upon details; details should depend upon abstractions.
- **Benefits**: Reduces coupling between code modules, making systems more reusable and robust to changes.

Understanding and applying the SOLID principles can lead to better software design, easier maintenance, and a more scalable system. Review these principles and think of examples from your experience where applying or ignoring them impacted a project.
