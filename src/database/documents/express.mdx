# Express.js Comprehensive Guide

Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It's widely acclaimed for simplifying the development of web applications and APIs. Below is an expanded guide that includes your new pointers.

## Introduction

Express.js facilitates the construction of server-side applications with Node.js by offering a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, emphasizing simplicity, middleware, routing, and performance.

## Key Features

- **Simplicity**: Streamlines web application and API development with Node.js.
- **Middleware**: Utilizes functions that access request and response objects, and the next middleware function, to execute code, alter request and response, and manage the request-response cycle.
- **Routing**: Employs a robust routing API to manage application responses to different HTTP methods and URL paths.
- **Performance**: Inherits Node.js's non-blocking I/O and the V8 JavaScript engine's speed.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for the choice of ORM, template engine, and more, without enforcing specific tools.

## Core Concepts

### Application Setup

A minimal server setup in Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'));

app.listen(port, () =>
	console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
);
```

### Middleware

Middleware functions can perform various tasks: code execution, modifications to request/response objects, ending the request-response cycle, and calling the next middleware.

#### Middleware Types

- **Application-level Middleware**: Attached with `app.use()` or `app.METHOD()`, where METHOD is the HTTP method. Applied globally or to specific routes.

  ```javascript
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
  	console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  	next();
  });
  ```

- **Router-level Middleware**: Similar to application-level but bound to an instance of `express.Router()`.

  ```javascript
  const router = express.Router();
  router.use((req, res, next) => {
  	console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
  	next();
  });
  ```

- **Error-handling Middleware**: Defined with four arguments instead of three, specifically for handling errors.

  ```javascript
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  	console.error(err.stack);
  	res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
  });
  ```

- **Built-in Middleware**: Comes with Express, like `express.static`, `express.json`, and `express.urlencoded`.

- **Third-party Middleware**: Added via `npm`, such as `body-parser`, `cors`, `morgan`.

  ```javascript
  const cors = require('cors');
  app.use(cors());
  ```

#### Using `next` in Middleware

`next` is used to pass control to the next middleware function. If not called, the request will hang.

```javascript
app.use(
	(req, res, next) => {
		console.log('Middleware 1');
		next();
	},
	(req, res) => {
		console.log('Middleware 2');
		res.send('Finished!');
	}
);
```

### Request and Response Objects

Express enhances these objects with additional features and methods to facilitate request handling and response sending.

- **Request Object (`req`)**: Represents the HTTP request. Contains properties like `req.body`, `req.params`, `req.query`, and methods like `req.get()`.

- **Response Object (`res`)**: Represents the HTTP response. Methods like `res.send()`, `res.status()`, and `res.json()` control the response sent back.

### Routing

Express's routing system allows actions based on HTTP methods and URLs.

```javascript
app
	.route('/users')
	.get((req, res) => {
		res.send('Get Users');
	})
	.post((req, res) => {
		res.send('Add User');
	});
```

### Scaffolding

Quickly bootstrap new Express applications using the `express-generator` package, which creates an application skeleton.

```shell
npm install -g express-generator
express myapp
```

### Handling CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can be managed using the `cors` middleware.

```javascript
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
```

### Template Engines

Express supports several template engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars, which allow for dynamic content rendering on the server side.

- **Setting Up a Template Engine**:

  ```javascript
  app.set('view engine', 'pug');
  ```

- **Rendering Views**:

  ```javascript
  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  	res.render('index', { title: 'Hey', message: 'Hello there!' });
  });
  ```

## Conclusion

Express.js stands out for its simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency in developing web

applications and APIs. Understanding its core concepts, including middleware, routing, and scaffolding, equips developers to build scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
