		"answer": "To implement JWT-based authentication in a Node.js application, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the 'jsonwebtoken' npm package to handle JWT generation and verification.\n2. Create routes in your Node.js application to handle user registration and login requests.\n3. When a user registers or logs in, generate a JWT containing the user's information (e.g., user ID) and sign it using a secret key.\n4. Send the JWT to the client as part of the authentication response.\n5. Secure routes that require authentication by verifying the JWT sent by the client using the secret key.\n6. Extract the user information from the JWT payload and use it to authenticate and authorize the user's access to protected resources.\n7. Implement middleware to handle JWT verification and authentication logic for protected routes.\n8. Optionally, include additional security measures like token expiration and token revocation to enhance security.\n9. Test your JWT-based authentication thoroughly to ensure it works as expected for different user scenarios.",
