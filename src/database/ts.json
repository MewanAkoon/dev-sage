		"question": "What is TypeScript and how does it differ from JavaScript?",
		"answer": "TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing capabilities to the language. This means that while JavaScript variables and parameters can be of any type without explicit declarations, TypeScript allows and requires you to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps in catching errors during development, improving code readability and maintainability. TypeScript is compiled into plain JavaScript, meaning any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.",

		"question": "Explain the purpose of type annotations in TypeScript.",
		"answer": "Type annotations in TypeScript are used to explicitly assign a type to variables, function parameters, and function return values. This helps in statically checking the types of data being used throughout the code, which can catch type-related errors during development before the code is compiled into JavaScript.

It specifies the properties that an object must have and their types, but it does not implement any functionality. Interfaces are used for type-checking to ensure that the objects conform to a specific structure, making the code more predictable and easier to manage.

This feature simplifies the code by reducing the need for explicit type annotations while still maintaining the benefits of type safety. It makes the code cleaner and easier to read, while still providing robust type checking.

		"answer": "The 'any' type in TypeScript is used to represent any JavaScript value without type-checking. It is a type-safe escape hatch that can be used when the type of a variable is unknown and cannot be declared from the beginning. Using 'any' allows assignments and operations on the variable without TypeScript's static type checking. However, it should be used sparingly as it defeats the purpose of TypeScript, which is to provide type safety.

In JavaScript, null and undefined are often interchangeable and both are considered 'falsy' values. However, in TypeScript with strict null checks, null and undefined are treated as distinct types. This means a variable declared to hold a string cannot be assigned null or undefined without explicitly declaring its type as 'string | null | undefined', which helps prevent runtime errors due to unintentional null or undefined values.",

The key difference between 'let' and 'const' is that 'let' allows re-assigning new values to variables, while 'const' requires variables to be assigned a value at declaration and cannot be reassigned thereafter.

This is denoted by the syntax 'string | number'. Union types are particularly useful for function parameters that might accept multiple types of arguments, enhancing the flexibility and reusability of functions.

For instance, a generic function to return the first element of an array regardless of its type could be written as: function firstElement<T>(arr: T[]): T | undefined { return arr[0]; } Here, <T> is a type variable that captures the type passed to the function at the time it's called, thus allowing the function to be used with arrays of any type.",

For example, you might have a 'User' type and an 'Admin' type. An intersection type 'User & Admin' then represents a type that is both a 'User' and an 'Admin'.

It is also useful in discriminated unions where exhaustive checks ensure that every case is covered, and the 'never' type can indicate an error if a case that shouldn't be possible is reached.

It is similar to type casting in other languages but performs no special checking or restructuring of data. This is done using the 'as' keyword, like 'let x: any = 'hello'; let s: string = x as string;'. The risk is that while it bypasses TypeScript’s static type checking, it does not change the type at runtime, which can lead to runtime errors if the assertion was incorrect.",

		"question": "Scenario: You are building a recipe sharing platform and need to implement functionality to manage recipes. How would you use TypeScript to define the structure of a recipe object and handle recipe management?",
		"answer": "To define the structure of a recipe object in TypeScript, you can create an interface with properties representing the recipe's information, such as title, ingredients, and instructions. Then, you can use TypeScript's type annotations to ensure that each field is of the correct type. For example:\ninterface Recipe {\n    title: string;\n    ingredients: string[];\n    instructions: string;\n}\nTo handle recipe management, you can create functions that allow users to add new recipes, edit existing recipes, and delete recipes. TypeScript's type system can help ensure that the data passed to and returned from these functions is properly formatted and avoid runtime errors.",

		"answer": "To handle asynchronous currency conversion requests in TypeScript, you can use async/await along with a library like axios to make HTTP requests to the external currency conversion API. You can define a function that takes the source currency, target currency, and amount as parameters, makes a request to the API, and returns the converted amount. TypeScript's type system can ensure that the input parameters are of the correct types, and the returned data matches the expected format.",

		"answer": "To integrate with a charting library in TypeScript, you can use a library like Chart.js or D3.js and create TypeScript definitions for the library's API if they are not already available. You can then define TypeScript interfaces for the chart data and options, ensuring type safety when constructing and configuring the charts. TypeScript's type system can help catch errors related to incorrect data types or options, providing a more robust development experience.",
